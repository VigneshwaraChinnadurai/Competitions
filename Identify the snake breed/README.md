This is a competition posted in Hacker-Earth and according to this I generated the submission and the percentage is aroung 39.87889.

As the dataset is too small for this classification (35 classes), trying hard through transfer learning to improve its performance. 

after submission I got some considerable rank (47 out of 3351 rank).

used Efficientnet B7 pre-trained weights to enhance the performance as my architecture build is not performing good.

used FastAI for model building.

Thanks for reading this. Have a great day.
